User Registration: Users typically start by creating an account on the platform. This may involve providing some personal information and creating a username/password.

Ad Posting: Once registered and logged in, users can create and post ads. They usually provide details such as the title, description, category (e.g., electronics, real estate, jobs), price, location, and contact information. They may also upload images or other media to accompany their ads.

Search and Browse: Other users can then browse through the posted ads. They can search for specific items using keywords or filters such as category, location, price range, etc. The platform may also provide recommendations or suggest relevant ads based on user preferences.
